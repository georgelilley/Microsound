//In this section of code(Lines 5-56) global variables are being initialised. Some are initialised with a value e.g. 'let directionx = 0' and some are empty e.g. 'var calx'. Also here I'm initialising global arrays for use later in the code indicated by '[]' e.g. 'let particles = []'    

let particles = []; //This initialises the array 'particles'. Each element in 'particles' contains an instance of the 'Mover' class which contains objects relating to information of that specific particle e.g. current positon, velocity etc,   

let check_Collision_array = []; // Initialises the array 'check_Collision_array'. This is used as a binary switch in the 'CollideSearch' function. It is used in an if statement within the function to ensure that the sound combination is only played once upon collision. It is an array form as it stores values for each element in particles independently.   

let Looper = []; //Initialises the array 'Looper'. Elements in this array are also used as binary switches within the 'CollideSearch' function in combination with IF ELSE Statements to make particles stop looping after a second collision when in looping mode.  

let rampvar = []; // Initialises the array 'rampvar'. This array is used in the 'myCallback' function to store the scaled value of the particle length slider 'ParticleTimeValScal' at the moment of audio recording. Elements in this array then contain the length of audio files for their respective audio files in the 'soundFile' array and I use 'rampvar' to create specific envelopes for these audio files.


var limiter, gainer, limiter2, limiter3; // Initialises these four variables. 'limiter''s are used as limiter and 'gainer' controls a gain object. These were some of the last additions to my code with the purpose of keeping volume levels undercontrol to try to avoid extreme distortion as there may be many audio files playing simultaneously. 

// Lines 17-21 initialise variables used in caculating the 'gravity' force for a particular particle.
let directionx = 0; // 'directionx' variable is assigned a value of either '1' or '-1' depending on the x coordinate of a particle (if it is on the left or right half of the game space) 

let directiony = 1; // 'directiony' variable is the same as for 'directionx' applied to the y-axis
var calx; // 'calx' is assigned the distance of a given particle's x coordinate to the centre
var caly; // 'caly' is the same as 'calx' for y axis.
let coefficient = 0; // The variable 'coefficient' is used to in applying velocity to each particle. The variable is assigned a value related to the proportional difference of the distance of a particle's x and y positions to the game center. It's used to create natural 'orbitting' movement as the value of coefficient changes with a particles position.

let mic; // Initialises the variable 'mic.'
let soundFile = []; //Initialises the 'soundFile' and 'soundFileL' arrays. These arrays store the individual sound particles/grains in individual indexes of the arrays. 
let soundFileL = []; // The 'soundFileL' array is separate as I've used separate arrays for when the particles just going to be played or looped. They contain the same audio files.
let env = []; // Initialises the 'env' array this is used to store individual envelopes for respective sound files in the 'soundFile' and 'soundFileL' arrays.
let recorder = []; // Initialises the 'recorder' and 'recorderL' array's each element in the arrays will contain a individual recorder object relating to an individual audio file being recorded for the same index in the 'soundFile' or 'soundFileL' arrays.  
let recorderL = [];
let state = 0; // Initialises the 'state' variable as '0'. This variable is used in 'mousePressed' function and is used in if statements to define the logic flow of the function. 
let state2 = 0; // Initialises the 'state2' variable as '0'. The variable is used in the 'buttonPressed()' and 'draw' functions. It indicates if the button has been pressed and is used to trigger audio recording.
var d; // Initialises variable 'd' used as a binary switch within the draw function ensuring that a section of code setting an interval for calling the 'Recording' function is only executed once.
let e = 0;
let q=0; // Initialised the variable 'q' as '0'. This variable simply keeps an index of the number of individual audio files that have been recorded (the same value as for 'soundFile' and 'soundFileL' not there value combined).
let releaseb=0; //Initialised the variable 'releaseb' as '0'. This variable is used to determine if the player has clicked on/near a particle and again (a different value is assigned) if they have released the mouse. 

var Mode; // Initialised variable 'Mode'.
